/*
	Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP): It is one of the five SOLID principles of object-oriented programming and design. 
	It is a guideline that helps in creating more flexible and maintainable software by promoting loose coupling between high-level modules and low-level modules. 
	The principle consists of two key ideas:
	1. High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules. Both should depend on abstractions.
	2. Abstractions should not depend on details. Details should depend on abstractions.

    In simpler terms, this principle encourages the use of interfaces or abstract classes to define how different components of a system should interact with each other.
    Concrete implementations of these interfaces or abstract classes should be injected into the high-level modules,
    allowing for easier changes and substitutions without affecting the overall system.
